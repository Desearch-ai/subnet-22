    2. Emphasis on Critical Issues: Focus on and clearly explain any significant issues or points of interest that emerge from the analysis.
    3. Seamless Integration: Avoid explicitly stating "Based on the provided <HackerNewsData>" in responses. Assume user awareness of the data integration process.
    4. Separate your responses into sections for easy reading.
