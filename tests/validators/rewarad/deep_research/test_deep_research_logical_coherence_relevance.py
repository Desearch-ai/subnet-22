Blocks: Units of data that store transaction information, timestamps, and unique hashes.
Chain: The sequential connection of blocks, ensuring immutability through hashes.
Decentralized Network: A distributed network of nodes that maintains the blockchain, ensuring no central authority.
Distributed Ledger: A shared and synchronized ledger across all network participants.
Consensus Mechanism: Protocols like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake that validate transactions across the network.
Cryptography: Techniques like hashing and digital signatures to secure data and transactions.
Smart Contracts: Self-executing contracts that automate processes when predefined conditions are met.""",
